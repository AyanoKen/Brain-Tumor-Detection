# Brain-Tumor-Detection

The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from â€¢	https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection

The downloaded dataset or any other dataset of images first needs to be converted from grayscale to rgb color space, this can be done by running the transformer.ipynb file, the only change needed to be done is changing the path of the dataset folder.
